## Software tools

- **Braindecode**: (https://braindecode.org/stable/index.html) Braindecode is an open-source Python toolbox for decoding raw electrophysiological brain data with deep learning models. It includes dataset fetchers, data preprocessing and visualization tools, as well as implementations of several deep learning architectures and data augmentations for analysis of EEG, ECoG and MEG.
- **PyEDFlib**: (https://pyedflib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) PyEDFlib is a Python library to read/write EDF/EDF+/BDF files based on EDFlib. The PyEDFlib Python toolbox is a fork of the python-edf toolbox from Christopher Lee-Messer. and uses the EDFlib from Teunis van Beelen.
- **MNE-Python**: (https://mne.tools/stable/index.html) MNE-Python is an open-source Python package for exploring, visualizing, and analyzing human neurophysiological data such as MEG, EEG, sEEG, ECoG, and more. It includes modules for data input/output, preprocessing, visualization, source estimation, time-frequency analysis, connectivity analysis, machine learning, statistics, and more.
- **TorchEEG**: (https://torcheeg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) TorchEEG is a library built on PyTorch for EEG signal analysis. TorchEEG aims to provide a plug-and-play EEG analysis tool, so that researchers can quickly reproduce EEG analysis work and start new EEG analysis research without paying attention to technical details unrelated to the research focus. TorchEEG specifies a unified data input-output format (IO) and implement commonly used EEG databases, allowing users to quickly access benchmark datasets and define new custom datasets. The datasets that have been defined so far include emotion recognition and so on.
- **EEGLAB**: (https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/) EEGLAB is an interactive Matlab toolbox for processing continuous and event-related EEG, MEG and other electrophysiological data incorporating independent component analysis (ICA), time/frequency analysis, artifact rejection, event-related statistics, and several useful modes of visualization of the averaged and single-trial data. EEGLAB runs under Linux, Unix, Windows, and Mac OS X.
- **MetaBCI**: (https://github.com/TBC-TJU/MetaBCI) MetaBCI is an open-source platform for non-invasive brain computer interface. The project of MetaBCI is led by Prof. Minpeng Xu from Tianjin University, China. MetaBCI has 3 main parts: 1) brainda: for importing dataset, pre-processing EEG data and implementing EEG decoding algorithms; 2) brainflow: a high speed EEG online data processing framework; 3) brainstim: a simple and efficient BCI experiment paradigms design module.
- **MOABB Mother of all BCI Benchmarks**: (https://moabb.neurotechx.com/docs/index.html) MOABB is an open-source Python framework designed to facilitate **reproducible research** in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), specifically for EEG-based decoding. It provides a standardized environment for benchmarking machine learning algorithms on publicly available EEG datasets. MOABB includes a variety of EEG datasets, eliminating the need for manual data collection, and ensures fair comparison between different decoding algorithms through standardized pipelines. It simplifies EEG data handling using MNE-Python and provides reliable performance comparisons under the same experimental conditions. MOABB is a powerful tool for researchers and developers working on EEG decoding and BCI applications.
